Robotics simulations using Webots

This repo consist of robotics simulations created in the opensource simulator Webots.
I'm currently on a learning path, I'll update the repo with the new projects as I progress

#1 Differential drive robot:
  It is the simulation of a custom made differential drive robot
  The current controller code makes the robot to follow the path of a polygon with the user desired number of sides
  The code is written in Python
  The robot is in an open loop control, therby it is susceptible to errors in motion.
